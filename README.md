## Funny Algorithms

_A repository with a bunch of funny algorithms, beginners friendly :sparkles:_

_Don't forget to read our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/usj-foss/FunnyAlgorithams/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/usj-foss/FunnyAlgorithams/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)_

## Algorithms are fun, right?

So why not add the funniest algorithms in this repository? We can share with all the world so people can have fun with us! 

You can contribute in two ways:

- Add a new algorithm inside a folder, name the folder with the type of the algorithm. Example: (Algorithm: bogoSort.c, folder: sort)
- Rewrite an existing algorithm in another programming language

It is always fun to check new algorithms or see how the same algorithms can be rewritten in different programming languages.


## How to Contribute

> **Note 1:** If you've never made a pull request before, or participated in an open-source project, we recommend taking a look at this [wonderful video tutorial](https://youtu.be/ZI2D0CI4TXs). And if you want a more complete tutorial on using github, creating branches etc. , [here's a detailed video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjQznt-8kE&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9goXbgTDQ0n_4TBzOO0ocPR).Once you've got your feet wet, you're ready to come back and dive into Hacktoberfest fun!

> **Note ** **Super Important** 

1. Star this repository. :stuck_out_tongue:

2. And then you have to fork (make a copy) of this repo to your Github account.

3. Clone (download) your fork to your computer.

4. Set your streams so you can sync your clone with the original repo (get the latest updates)

   - [ ] <code>git remote add upstream https://github.com/usj-foss/FunnyAlgorithams </code>

   - [ ] <code>git pull upstream main</code>

   - [ ] The above 2 commands will synchronize your forked version of the project with the actual repository.

5. Create a branch with your username.

6. Make the changes in your branch. For eg. You're creating a navbar using ReactJS and your username is xyz so you've to follow the path /Algorithm Collections/[YOUR__FILE] and same goes with others.

7. Commit and push the code to YOUR fork.

8. Create a pull request to have the changes merged into the origin.
